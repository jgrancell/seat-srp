## Quick Installation:

In your seat directory (By default:  /var/www/seat), type the following:

```
php artisan down
composer require denngarr/seat-srp
```

(You can skip this step if you are running 3.x)
After a successful installation, you can include the actual plugin by editing **config/app.php** and adding the following after:

```
        /*
         * Package Service Providers...
         */
```
add
```
        Denngarr\Seat\SeatSrp\SrpServiceProvider::class
```

and save the file.  Now you're ready to tell SeAT how to use the plugin:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --force
php artisan migrate

php artisan up
```

And now, when you log into SeAT, you should see a 'Ship Replacement Program' link on the left.

## SRP Payout Calculations

### Simple SRP

By default, the application is configured in simple mode. In this mode, the SRP payout is calculated by using the evepraisal value returned from Jita sell for the whole killmail.

### Advanced SRP

Advanced SRP can be enabled in the settings menu. Once enabled, the SRP Admin will need to specify rules around payout calculations. The rule types available are `Type`, `Group` and `Default`. The rules are matched in that order with the first match being used to calculate payout value.

#### Shared Configuration Options

- **Price Source** - Where the pricing of individual elements will be drawn from
- **Base Value** - A fixed ISK amount added to each payout from this rule
- **Hull %** - The percentage of the ship hull value to be paid out. 
- **Fit %** - The percentage of the ship fit value to be paid out. 
- **Cargo %** - The percentage of the ship cargo value to be paid out. 
- **Deduct Insurance** - If selected, the payout will be reduced by the benefit gained from insurance (payout - cost)

#### Rule Types

##### Type Rules
Type rules match the ship type exactly, for example a Scorpion or Blackbird. Note that variants are considered separate ships. Ie a Raven is different to a Raven Navy Issue. 

##### Group Rules
Group rules match based on the group of the ship, such as `Frigate`, `Shuttle` or `Battleship`.

##### Default Rule
The default rule is the rule used when there are no type or group rules that have been triggered. The default rule is a catch all for any remaining payout calculations.

## Discord Webhook (optional)

Good luck, and Happy Hunting!!  o7


## Usage Tracking

This fork rips out the shitty version tracking that Crypta-Eve placed in the upstream version, since it's a GDPR violation and the user has no way to opt out of their IP being tracked.
